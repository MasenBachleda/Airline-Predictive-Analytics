# Airline-Predictive-Analytics
This project I was asked to develop a model to classify MidWest customers as to whether they purchase a wireless phone service contract (target variable Phone_sale), that can be used to predict classifications for additional customers. I developed two logistic regression models and two neural network models. I then calculated the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1 score for each model to determine which model would predict classifications for additional customers with the greatest significance. I ended up suggesting the neural network with 100 nodes, as it had the highest measures.
